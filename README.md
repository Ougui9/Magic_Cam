# Orientation Estimation with Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF)

This is a program with two function to beautify/change your appearance. This first one is removing or extenuating your wrinkles. The second is to mix your facial features with another person's through automatically detection. 

## Getting Started
1. Run main.py
2. For wrinkle extenuation, this function will capture a image with your webcam. For mixing features, you need to put 2 image named 'source.jpg' and 'target.jpg' under root respectively. 
3. Run main.py and then follow the suggestions in console. 
```
python main.py
```
